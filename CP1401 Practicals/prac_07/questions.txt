Quick Questions

1)Where should global constants be placed in a program?
2)What are two reasons why you should not use global variables?
3)When you have two variables with the same name but in different functions, these said to have different ____?
4)What do you call the red dot in the margin in PyCharm that pauses the program running when using the debugger?
5)Briefly explain what would be wrong if you had a line of code like SOME_VALUE += 1 (assume that SOME_VALUE is actually a meaningful name).
6)What is the single most important design principle for designing functions?

Answers:
1) Global constants are placed above or outside all functions in a program.
2) Two reasons are:
   i)Functions using global variables are generally dependent on these variables and therefore are hard to be reused in another program.
   ii) Global variables make debugging of the code harder as they are placed in multiple places in a program.
3)These variables are said to have different scopes.
4)They are known as breakpoints.
5)This line of code is incorrect because SOME_VALUE is a global constant and its value cannot be changed throughout the program.
6)The Single Responsibility Principle is the most important design principle for designing functions.
