Logic Exercise:

When asked her 3 children's ages, Mrs. Muddled said that Alice is the youngest unless Bill is, and that if Carl isn't the youngest then Alice is the oldest.
Who is the oldest and who is the youngest?

Answer: Alice is the eldest child and Bill is the youngest. This is because if Bill is not youngest then Alice becoems youngest and Carl is also not the youngest. But when carl is not the youngest , Alice has to be the eldest so this case is not possible. If Carl is the youngest , bill is not and if bill is not youngest then alice has to be youngest which again is not possible in this case. Therefore if Bill is youngest, Carl is not youngest which implies that Alice is the oldest which is possible.
