5)What are augmented assignment operators?

Answers:
1)The keyboard shortcut for commenting out/in is control+/ in windows and command+/ in MacOS.
2)The 2 kinds of loops available in python are for loop(definite) and while loop(indefinite).
3)The value which terminates a loop is called sentinal.
4)It has an Uppercase character in the middle of its name which is not allowed in python.
5)In python, augmented operators are += , -=,*=,/=

Range:
a)Loop outputs:
# 1.
for i in range(6):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()

# 2.
for i in range(33, 39):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()

# 3.
for i in range(17, 11, -1):
    print(i, end=' ')
print()

# 4.
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i % 2, end=' ')
print()

# 5.
for i in range(10, 0, -2):
    print(i ** 2, end='>')
print()

b)Write the range statements (just range and parameters, not the whole loop) equivalent to the following lists of numbers:

1)[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

2)[1, 5, 9, 13]

3)[3, 2, 1]

4)[7, 4, 1, -2, -5]

Logic Exercise:

There are three boxes which each contains two marbles:

one has two white,
one has two black, and
one has one white and one black marble.
Each of the boxes also is labeled as to its contents, but the labels have been swapped around and each label is incorrect.
What is the fewest number of marbles you could remove from the boxes and look at in order to definitely determine the contents of all three boxes?

Answer:
We have to pick 3 balls in total in order to be able to state the contents of all the 3 boxes.
